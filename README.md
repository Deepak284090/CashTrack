# Cash Track

Cash Track is a comprehensive financial management application designed for nuclear families with multiple earners. This platform allows family members to efficiently track their individual earnings and expenses while managing shared financial responsibilities, such as monthly bills and recurring costs. By providing tools for real-time financial tracking, expense analysis, and detailed reporting, Cash Track aims to simplify financial management for households with multiple contributors.

## Introduction

In todayâ€™s fast-paced world, managing household finances can be challenging, especially for nuclear families with several income sources. Cash Track helps address common pain points by providing an automated system to track earnings, expenses, and financial transactions. It ensures that all family members contribute fairly to shared expenses, and allows for transparent and real-time financial management.

## Objectives

- **Track individual earnings and expenses**: Each family member can securely manage their own finances.
- **Manage shared expenses**: Admins can configure recurring shared expenses (e.g., rent, utilities) and distribute them among selected family members.
- **Expense limits**: Users and admins can set limits for personal expenses, with notifications if the limit is exceeded.
- **Expense reports**: Visualize spending patterns and generate reports for detailed analysis.
- **Role-based access**: Admins have the ability to manage settings and configure shared responsibilities, while users can only access their own financial data.
